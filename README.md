# System-Evaluation
Code from various case studies conducted as a part of SYS 3034 at UVA. Code is messy but focused on producing visulizations and statistics which support recommendations in the associated powerpoints.

- Baseball case was focused on regression analysis, with some other ML models (unsuccessfully) attempted

- Birdstrikes case focused on categorical data anlysis centerd around chi^2 tables (data can be found from https://wildlife.faa.gov/home and https://www.transtats.bts.gov/TRAFFIC/)

- Glass Ceiling case had a pretty broad focus and made use of categorical and continuous data analysis in context. I'm most proud of this case so far, we did a lot of additional work scraping data off the internet to get as best a picture as possible to understand many aspects of what constitutes gender equality at UVA.
