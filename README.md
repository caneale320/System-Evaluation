# System-Evaluation
Code from various case studies conducted as a part of SYS 3034 at UVA. Code is messy but focused on producing visulizations and statistics which support recommendations in the associated powerpoints.

- Baseball case was focused on regression analysis, with some other ML models (unsuccessfully) attempted

- Birdstrikes case focused on categorical data anlysis centerd around chi^2 tables (data can be found from https://wildlife.faa.gov/home and https://www.transtats.bts.gov/TRAFFIC/)

- Glass Ceiling case had a pretty broad focus and made use of categorical and continuous data analysis in context. We did a lot of additional work scraping data off the internet to get as best a picture as possible to understand many aspects of what constitutes gender equality at UVA.

- Atlanta Public Schools was another broad case, requiring a lot of additional research to understand not just the data we were looking at but the larger system we were working in. Regression analysis was the primary driver of recommendations here but a wide variety of statistical approaches were used.
